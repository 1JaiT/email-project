reflections: Why is coding HTML for Email different from web coding?  I would say how it is set up. in the email coding 
everything is right there like the css, and there is not a unversial rule for email like it is for web. Plus you are using table in email
code.
What concepts help coders work around the limitations of HTML in Emails?  You canwork around and use other options to get waht you want
the email to look like.
